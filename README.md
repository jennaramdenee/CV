## Jenna Ramdenee

Full stack developer, passionate about technology and how it constantly affects how the world operates.

I've always enjoyed working with technology and my recent enrollment in Makers Academy has helped me delve further into the technical intricacies behind creating beautiful things that we often take for granted.

It has reminded me of my nerdy maths love and reignited by enthusiam with learning new things (with the additional benefit of actually being able to apply them); something I definitely want to continue in my life.

Looking for an exciting opportunity in an area that I care about, in a company with values I share, with a team that encourages and pushes me to constantly achieve more.
