## Jenna Ramdenee

Full stack developer, interested in how technology constantly affects how the world operates.

I've always worked with technology and my recent enrollment in Makers Academy has helped me dive even further into the intricacies behind creating beautiful things.

Looking for an opportunity that I can be passionate about, in a company with values I share, with a team that encourages and pushes me to constantly achieve more.
