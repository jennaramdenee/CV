## Jenna Ramdenee

Technology consultant turned wannabe developer.

For a very long time now, every time I have seen a beautiful web page, a really impressive gadget or someone pondering over some code in a hipster coffee shop, I think "That's awesome, I would love to be able to do that!".

While I've always worked in the realm of technology, I've never really felt like I've been a part of it. Fed up of looking from the outside in, I am making bold steps to get involved, get my hands dirty and create something beautiful. 

Looking for an opportunity that I can be passionate about, in a company with values I share, with a team that encourages and pushes me to constantly achieve more.
